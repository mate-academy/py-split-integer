# Split integer
- Read [the guideline](https://github.com/mate-academy/py-task-guideline/blob/main/README.md) before start

Write tests for `split_integer` function that takes 2 positive integers `value`
and `number_of_parts` and returns an array containing exactly `number_of_parts` 
integer elements.

- The difference between the max and min number in the array should be <= 1
- The array should be sorted ascending (from lowest to highest)

You don't need to validate arguments (they are always valid).

Examples:
```
split_integer(8, 1) == [8]
split_integer(6, 2) == [3, 3]
split_integer(17, 4) == [4, 4, 4, 5]
split_integer(32, 6) == [5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6]
```

Notes:
- Write tests in the `/app/test_split_integer.py` module
- Their names indicate what exactly they should test

Run `pytest app/` to check if function pass your tests.

Run `pytest --numprocesses=auto tests/` to check if your tests cover all boundary conditions
and pass task tests.
